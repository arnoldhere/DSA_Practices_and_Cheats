ðŸ§  Core Data Structures to Prepare:
1. Arrays
Basics: Traversing, Insertion, Deletion

Concepts: Prefix Sum, Sliding Window, Two Pointers

Interview Questions: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm, Max Subarray, Merge Sorted Arrays

2. Strings
String manipulation (concatenation, reversal, palindrome checks)

Pattern Matching: KMP, Rabin-Karp (basics)

Questions: Longest Palindromic Substring, Anagram checks, Edit Distance

3. Linked Lists
Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular

Operations: Reversal, Detect Loop (Floydâ€™s Cycle), Merge two sorted lists

Questions: LRU Cache (often uses Linked List + HashMap)

4. Stacks & Queues
Implementations using arrays or linked lists

Applications: Expression evaluation, Balanced parentheses, Next Greater Element

Special Structures:

Min Stack

Circular Queue

Deque (double-ended queue)

5. Hashing / Hash Tables / Dictionaries
HashMap / HashSet in Java, Python dict, C++ unordered_map

Use for frequency counting, duplicate detection, etc.

Questions: Two Sum, Subarray with 0 Sum, Group Anagrams

6. Trees
Types: Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Trie (optional but good)

Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (both recursive and iterative)

Questions: Lowest Common Ancestor, Diameter of Tree, Balanced Tree check

7. Heaps (Priority Queues)
Max-Heap, Min-Heap

Applications: K Largest Elements, Merge K Sorted Lists, Heap Sort

8. Graphs
Representations: Adjacency Matrix/List

Traversals: BFS, DFS (recursive & iterative)

Concepts: Cycle detection, Topological Sort, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Union-Find

Questions: Number of Islands, Shortest Path in Maze, Graph Coloring

9. Recursion & Backtracking
Problems: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Generation

Master base cases, recursive calls, and pruning for optimization

10. Dynamic Programming (DP)
Patterns: 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Coin Change

Must-know questions: Fibonacci (memoization + tabulation), LCS, LIS, DP on grids

11. Tries (Advanced, optional for most roles but good for product-based companies)
Applications: Auto-complete, Prefix matching

Questions: Word Search, Implement Trie
